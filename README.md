# Barcelona Airbnb Analytics: From Raw Data to Investment Strategy

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project explores **Airbnb listings in Barcelona** using a two-step pipeline:
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** – transforming raw Airbnb data into a clean, structured dataset ready for modeling.
2. **Predictive Modeling & Investment Strategy** – applying machine learning (XGBoost with tidymodels) to predict prices, evaluate model performance, and design a real estate investment strategy under a €3M budget.

This project demonstrates the full workflow of a **data analyst + data scientist**, from wrangling raw messy data to generating **business insights**.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**: tidyverse, data.table, stringi  
- **Feature Engineering**: creation of boolean features from amenities & host verifications  
- **Predictive Modeling**: tidymodels, XGBoost, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning  
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE  
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, leaflet (geospatial analysis), ROI/payback plots  
- **Business Insight**: Real estate investment analysis, ROI & payback calculations, scenario planning

## 📊 Key Results
- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Reduced raw dataset (19k+ listings, 250+ features) into a structured dataset with standardized numeric, boolean, and categorical features.  
- ✅ **Modeling**: XGBoost achieved strong performance (low RMSE & MAE, good R²). Predictions aligned well for mid-range prices.  
- ✅ **Geospatial Insights**: Most neighborhoods had low prediction errors, with some (Gracia, Eixample) showing higher variance.  
- ✅ **Investment Strategy**: Designed two scenarios under a €3M budget –  
  - **Risky Portfolio**: Diversified across Sants-Montjuïc, Nou Barris, Sant Andreu, Eixample, Ciutat Vella  
  - **Less Risky Portfolio**: Focused on Sants-Montjuïc and Nou Barris for stable ROI

## 📈 Why This Project Matters
This project highlights **end-to-end data expertise**:
- From **data wrangling** → **predictive modeling** → **business recommendations**  
- Demonstrates both **technical skills** (R, tidymodels, XGBoost) and **business acumen** (ROI analysis, portfolio design).  

Recruiters can see how I:
- Handle messy, real-world data  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models  
- Translate results into actionable investment strategies
